Host Discovery Scans

--> Ping Scan (Find Live Devices)
nmap -sn <range>
Finds which devices are online without scanning ports.
Use when: First step — see what's on the network.

--> Skip Ping (Assume Host is Up)
nmap -Pn <target>
Doesn't check if host is up, goes straight to scanning.
Use when: Firewall blocks ping but services are still running.

--> List Scan
nmap -sL <range>
Lists all targets without actually scanning them.
Use when: You want to verify what IPs nmap will scan before running it.
