Scan Types

--> TCP SYN Scan (Stealth)
nmap -sS <target>
Half-open scan, doesn't complete the connection.
Use when: Default go-to scan. Fast and stealthy. Needs root/sudo.

--> TCP Connect Scan
nmap -sT <target>
Full TCP connection to each port.
Use when: You don't have root/sudo access.

--> UDP Scan
nmap -sU <target>
Scans UDP ports instead of TCP.
Use when: Looking for DNS (53), SNMP (161), DHCP (67/68) services. Very slow — combine with -F or specific ports.

--> ACK Scan
nmap -sA <target>
Sends ACK packets to check firewall rules.
Use when: You want to know if a firewall is filtering ports.
